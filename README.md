PiChore -  A Raspberry Pi Chore and Allowance Tracker
===

### As my kids got older, keeping track of which chores had been done and when they were done became more and more of a hassle. Especially with allowance becoming more important, I wanted a way to make sure we could keep everything tracked accurately. 
### As it turns out, touch screens for the Raspberry Pi are cheap! And I definitely had an old Pi in a closet that I could use to try out building this app to keep running on my counter.
